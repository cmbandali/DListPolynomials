# DListPolynomials
This is a Polynomial Caculator! The class, DListPoly, stores terms of a polynomial given as a string into DNodes. The head stores the term with the highest degree and the tail stores the term with the lowest degree. The class uses DList, DNode, Polynomial and Term objects to create the Linked List. After Two DListPoly's are created, a user can add, subtract, multiply, divide and find the modulus of the two polynomials
