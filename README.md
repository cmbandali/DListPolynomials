# DListPolynomials
This class,DListPoly, stores terms of a polynomial given as a string into DNodes of a linked list.
The head stores the term with the highest degree and the tail stores the term with the
lowest degree. 
The implementation of the classes used to create the class DListPoly were implemented already for me.



This was a Data Structures homework assignment
